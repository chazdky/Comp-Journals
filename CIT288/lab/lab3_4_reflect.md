You may need to do some research outside the text and lab info for some of these.  Google is your friend.
1.  As an administrator, would you choose to use your router, or your domain controller as your DHCP?  No right or wrong answer, but the choice is important when considering your infrastructure.  
2.  What is wrong with a DHCP without lease time restrictions?  
3.  Why don't we see WINS servers anymore?  Is there still a reason we would have to have one in our network?
4.  How important is a limited pool of IP's in a given DHCP domain?  Why?
5.  Why would DHCP just use UDP?  Why not TCP?
6.  Why is it a good idea to require a DHCP server to be authorized?
7.  MAC address reservations are a good stopgap for unauthorized access to a DHCP scope, but can you think of a situation in which an attacker with a laptop inside the network could thwart this?
8.  Why would we want to exclude certain IP's from our pool/scope?
9.  Why would it be important to activate the DNS role in a domain controller rather than the router or firewall?
10.  Is there a way to have DNS running on more than one device in the network?  How?  
From lab 4:
11.  what is done to configure TELNET server on a device?
12.  How is SSHD configured on a Linux Backtrack/Kali?
13.  List the port numbers for the following:  FTP, TELNET, SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, and TFTP.
14.  Should a firewall ever allow ALL outbound traffic to leave the network?  Why or why not?  
15.  Why block Ping?
16.  Why block FTP?
