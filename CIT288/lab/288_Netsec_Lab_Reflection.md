Netsec lab reflection

From NetSec lab 5:
1.  What does the route add command do?
2.  Why is NAT so imprtant to the security of a private network?
3.  What is "sniffing"?
4.  If a host is known to be alive on a network, what could cause it NOT to respond to ping requests?
5.  How can we view ALL interfaces on a linux machine in a single command?
6.  What switch in the ping command for linux will limit the number of pings?
