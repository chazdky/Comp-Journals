With Windows 7 going end-of-life, many organizations are exploring what it would look like to move their desktop platform from Windows to Linux. Research advantages, disadvantages, and your opinion on whether this might be the right move for these organizations to migrate to a Linux desktop environment.

By Thursday, create a thread minimum 200 words summarizing your research, citing at least two sources (Wikipedia is a weak source, find another.)

By Sunday, reply to at least two classmate's threads with minimum 100 words.

I think that with the ending of Windows 7, many people should consider a move to Linux.
I believe that is much more accessible now than ever before.
That being said, I also think that many people will be using Linux now more than ever before.
Microsoft has made their deals with Ubuntu and Cannonical and are now producing their own Linux kernel
and their own Linux file system within The windows insider's program,
but this will come in the next month or so to the vanilla windows 10 environment with the 20h1 upgrade.
And this is fantastic.

Organizationally, The advantages of switching to Linux, would be the memory intensity.
Windows 10 requires considerably more ram for general use, as well as, much more ram for each program implemented.
Linux does not have these hang ups. Linux also allows ACLs as we've learned on each file,
each directory, and each program within the system.
More more user friendly and accessible than windows 10.

The disadvantages of Linux server vs Windows server, Linux misses the consistency of Windows.
This is a key advantage of an organization. Customer support is another key feature.
Red Hat does provide support for a fee, as does cannonical with Ubuntu server, again, for a fee.
But Windows is included, while not great, it is there. the second big feature is administrators.
There are currently more windows system administrators in the workforce than there are Linux sys admins.
When upgrading windows you can assume that everything will play nicely, and stay the same,
buttons where they should be, things called the same, and easier to download and implement sys applications.
Where as Linux can bring challenges and headaches in these areas.
