While Linux, has a small foothold on the world of desktop operating systems. 
It maintains one of the strongest holds on the world's most powerful 
websites and servers in the world. 23 of the top 25 largest websites
run on Linux servers and have Linux backbones.[1]
I wanted to get deeper into a breakdown of Google and Facebook.
These two have built their own distributions (distros) of Linux.
Google before 2018 ran on a flavor built and maintained in house, 
it was called Goobuntu. But, in 2018 they made the switch from an
Ubuntu flavor to a flavor based on Debian-testing branch, GLinux.
GLinux isn't commercially available.[2] 
The other large cloud-computing platform built with large scale 
Linux architecture is Amazon, and Amazon Web Services. Amazon
Web Services has a distribution called Amazon Linux AMI, that is
ready-made and deployable on their servers. Amazon Linux AMI is based on
Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a virtual
appliance used to create a virtual machine. It contains a template for
the root volume system, launch permissions that control accounts, and 
a block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach when launched.
It also, gives you freedom to choose what kernel you would like to use.[3]
